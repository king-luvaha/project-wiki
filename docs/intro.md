## What You'll Need

To get the most out of MekSense and follow along with our examples and tutorials, we recommend having a few essential tools ready. These will help you seamlessly interact with our features and build effectively:

* **Integrated Development Environment (IDE):** A powerful code editor like **VS Code (Visual Studio Code)** is highly recommended. It offers excellent support for various programming languages, extensions, and integrated terminals, making your development workflow smoother.
* **Node.js (version 18.0 or above):** If our products involve web development, build tools, or server-side JavaScript, having Node.js installed is crucial. When you're installing it, we suggest checking all checkboxes related to dependencies to ensure everything works correctly.
* **Python (version 3.8 or above):** For tasks involving scripting, data processing, automation, or machine learning functionalities within our offerings, a recent version of Python will be indispensable.
* **Relevant Libraries/SDKs:** Depending on which MekSense product or service you're focusing on, you might also need specific libraries, SDKs (Software Development Kits), or framework installations. Don't worry, we'll guide you to these exact requirements within the relevant sections of this documentation.
