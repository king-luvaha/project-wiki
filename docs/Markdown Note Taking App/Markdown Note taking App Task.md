- Build a note-taking app that uses markdown for formatting.

You are required to build a simple note-taking app that lets users upload markdown files, check the grammar, save the note, and render it in HTML. The goal of this project is to help you learn how to handle file uploads in a RESTful API, parse and render markdown files using libraries, and check the grammar of the notes.

## Features

You have to implement the following features:

- You’ll provide an endpoint to check the grammar of the note.
- You’ll also provide an endpoint to save the note that can be passed in as Markdown text.
- Provide an endpoint to list the saved notes (i.e. uploaded markdown files).
- Return the HTML version of the Markdown note (rendered note) through another endpoint.
