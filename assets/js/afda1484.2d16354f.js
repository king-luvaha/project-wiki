I did too. That\'s why I built **\\"Ninja Game\\"**, a pixel-art style platformer written entirely in Python using **Pygame**.\\n\\nIn this post, I\u2019ll walk you through how I designed and implemented a 2D platformer with an integrated **tile-based map editor**, sprite animation system, and basic AI \u2014 all while keeping the project organized and extensible.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## \ud83e\uddf1 Why I Built a Level Editor\\n\\nGame development is more than just jumping and shooting \u2014 it\u2019s about designing the world. So I built a **tilemap editor** that allows me to:\\n\\n- Place tiles from grouped assets (grass, stone, decor, etc.)\\n    \\n- Use scrollable canvas to design large levels\\n    \\n- Add enemies or decorations as \\"offgrid\\" tiles\\n    \\n- Save/load levels using JSON\\n    \\n\\n> \ud83d\udd01 The level editor also features mouse-wheel tile selection and simple `autotile` support for better visuals.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## \ud83d\ude80 Key Features\\n\\n### \u2705 Core Gameplay\\n\\n- Responsive platformer mechanics with double jump and wall slide\\n    \\n- Dashing system that creates spark and particle trails\\n    \\n- Enemies that patrol and shoot based on player distance\\n    \\n\\n### \ud83e\udde0 Entities\\n\\n- **Player**: Dashing, jumping, wall sliding, and flipping\\n    \\n- **Enemy**: AI-based shooting behavior and knockback when hit\\n    \\n- **Particles**: For leaves, sparks, and hit effects\\n    \\n\\n### \ud83e\uddf0 Tools and Utilities\\n\\n- **`Animation` class** for smooth sprite transitions\\n    \\n- **`Tilemap` system** for both grid and off-grid objects\\n    \\n- **Asset loader** using `load_images()` and `load_image()` utilities\\n    \\n\\n---\\n\\n## \ud83d\uddfa\ufe0f Map Editing: Tips and Gotchas\\n\\nWhen working in `editor.py`, keep the following in mind:\\n\\n- **Offgrid Placement**: Objects like `decor`, `spawners`, or `enemy` must be placed **offgrid** using `G` key toggle. On-grid placement will crash the game during runtime.\\n    \\n- **Player Spawn Point**: Manually place a `player` entity **offgrid** near the level\u2019s start. Otherwise, the player may respawn at the wrong location (like the death spot) after getting hit.\\n    \\n\\nThe editor is fully mouse-driven and supports save/load via the `O` key.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## \ud83d\udcc1 Folder Structure\\n\\n```\\nninja_game/\\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 data/\\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 images/          # Sprites (player, enemy, tiles, etc.)\\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 maps/            # JSON level files\\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 sfx/             # Sound effects\\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 music.wav        # Background music\\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 scripts/\\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 clouds.py        # Parallax clouds system\\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 entities.py      # PhysicsEntity, Player, Enemy\\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 particle.py      # Particle rendering\\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 spark.py         # Sparks from dashing and shooting\\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 tilemap.py       # Map rendering and saving\\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 utils.py         # Asset loading and animation\\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 editor.py            # Level editor (run separately)\\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 game.py              # Main game logic and loop\\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 map.json             # Default map file\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n## \ud83d\udd79\ufe0f Controls\\n\\n### In Game (`game.py`)\\n\\n- **A / D / W / S** \u2014 Move\\n    \\n- **J** \u2014 Jump (with wall jump and double jump)\\n    \\n- **K** \u2014 Dash\\n    \\n- **ESC** \u2014 Quit\\n    \\n\\n### In Editor (`editor.py`)\\n\\n- **Mouse Left Click** \u2014 Place tile\\n    \\n- **Mouse Right Click** \u2014 Delete tile\\n    \\n- **Scroll Wheel** \u2014 Change tile group or variant\\n    \\n- **G** \u2014 Toggle ongrid / offgrid placement\\n    \\n- **O** \u2014 Save map to `map.json`\\n    \\n- **T** \u2014 Run `autotile()` for smoother edge tiles\\n    \\n\\n---\\n\\n## \ud83d\udd28 What I Learned\\n\\n- Handling collisions frame-by-frame using bounding rectangles\\n    \\n- Building reusable animation systems\\n    \\n- Managing parallax with varying cloud depths\\n    \\n- Designing for extensibility with asset-based organization\\n    \\n- JSON as a lightweight map format\\n    \\n\\n---\\n\\n## \ud83d\udce6 Future Improvements\\n\\n- Add GUI tile picker to the editor\\n    \\n- Camera shake during explosions\\n    \\n- Boss fights with multiple attack patterns\\n    \\n- Exporting maps to external game engines\\n    \\n\\n---\\n\\n## \ud83d\udcac Final Thoughts\\n\\nThis project was a powerful learning experience in **game architecture, data-driven design, and asset management**.
