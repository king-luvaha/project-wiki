I did too. That\'s why I built **\\"Ninja Game\\"**, a pixel-art style platformer written entirely in Python using **Pygame**.\\n\\nIn this post, I\u2019ll walk you through how I designed and implemented a 2D platformer with an integrated **tile-based map editor**, sprite animation system, and basic AI \u2014 all while keeping the project organized and extensible.\\n\\n---\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## \ud83e\uddf1 Why I Built a Level Editor\\n\\nGame development is more than just jumping and shooting \u2014 it\u2019s about designing the world. So I built a **tilemap editor** that allows me to:\\n\\n- Place tiles from grouped assets (grass, stone, decor, etc.)\\n- Use scrollable canvas to design large levels\\n- Add enemies or decorations as \\"offgrid\\" tiles\\n- Save/load levels using JSON \\n\\n> \ud83d\udd01 The level editor also features mouse-wheel tile selection and simple `autotile` support for better visuals.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## \ud83d\ude80 Key Features\\n\\n### \u2705 Core Gameplay\\n\\n- Responsive platformer mechanics with double jump and wall slide  \\n- Dashing system that creates spark and particle trails   \\n- Enemies that patrol and shoot based on player distance  \\n\\n### \ud83e\udde0 Entities\\n\\n- **Player**: Dashing, jumping, wall sliding, and flipping \\n- **Enemy**: AI-based shooting behavior and knockback when hit\\n- **Particles**: For leaves, sparks, and hit effects\\n\\n### \ud83e\uddf0 Tools and Utilities\\n\\n- **`Animation` class** for smooth sprite transitions\\n- **`Tilemap` system** for both grid and off-grid objects\\n- **Asset loader** using `load_images()` and `load_image()` utilities \\n\\n---\\n\\n## \ud83d\uddfa\ufe0f Map Editing: Tips and Gotchas\\n\\nWhen working in `editor.py`, keep the following in mind:\\n\\n- **Offgrid Placement**: Objects like `decor`, `spawners`, or `enemy` must be placed **offgrid** using `G` key toggle. On-grid placement will crash the game during runtime.  \\n- **Player Spawn Point**: Manually place a `player` entity **offgrid** near the level\u2019s start. Otherwise, the player may respawn at the wrong location (like the death spot) after getting hit.\\n\\nThe editor is fully mouse-driven and supports save/load via the `O` key.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## \ud83d\udcc1 Folder Structure\\n\\n```\\nninja_game/\\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 data/\\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 images/          # Sprites (player, enemy, tiles, etc.)\\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 maps/            # JSON level files\\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 sfx/             # Sound effects\\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 music.wav        # Background music\\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 scripts/\\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 clouds.py        # Parallax clouds system\\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 entities.py      # PhysicsEntity, Player, Enemy\\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 particle.py      # Particle rendering\\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 spark.py         # Sparks from dashing and shooting\\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 tilemap.py       # Map rendering and saving\\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 utils.py         # Asset loading and animation\\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 editor.py            # Level editor (run separately)\\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 game.py              # Main game logic and loop\\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 map.json             # Default map file\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n## \ud83d\udd79\ufe0f Controls\\n\\n### In Game (`game.py`)\\n\\n- **A / D / W / S** \u2014 Move  \\n- **J** \u2014 Jump (with wall jump and double jump) \\n- **K** \u2014 Dash \\n- **ESC** \u2014 Quit \\n\\n### In Editor (`editor.py`)\\n\\n- **Mouse Left Click** \u2014 Place tile\\n- **Mouse Right Click** \u2014 Delete tile\\n- **Scroll Wheel** \u2014 Change tile group or variant\\n- **G** \u2014 Toggle ongrid / offgrid placement\\n- **O** \u2014 Save map to `map.json`\\n- **T** \u2014 Run `autotile()` for smoother edge tiles \\n\\n---\\n\\n## \ud83d\udd28 What I Learned\\n\\n- Handling collisions frame-by-frame using bounding rectangles\\n- Building reusable animation systems\\n- Managing parallax with varying cloud depths\\n- Designing for extensibility with asset-based organization\\n- JSON as a lightweight map format\\n\\n---\\n\\n## \ud83d\udce6 Future Improvements\\n\\n- Add GUI tile picker to the editor\\n- Camera shake during explosions\\n- Boss fights with multiple attack patterns\\n- Exporting maps to external game engines  \\n\\n---\\n\\n## \ud83d\udcac Final Thoughts\\n\\nThis project was a powerful learning experience in **game architecture, data-driven design, and asset management**.

As a full-stack developer, you\u2019re likely familiar with building applications from scratch using frameworks and libraries like Node.js, Express, NestJS, React, Angular, and Vue.js. However, with the rise of Content Management Systems (CMS) such as Strapi, WordPress, and others, it\u2019s worth considering when a CMS might be a better choice than a custom-built solution.\\n\\nThis article explores scenarios where using a CMS is more advantageous than a framework or library, and when it makes sense to stick with traditional development approaches. We\u2019ll also highlight some of the top CMS options for both frontend and backend development.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Not Every Website Needs a Framework \ud83d\udeab\ud83e\udde9\\n\\nWhile frameworks and libraries like React, Angular, or NestJS offer powerful tools for building custom web applications, they aren\u2019t always the best choice. Developing a website or application from scratch can be time-consuming, expensive, and overkill for certain projects. For example, a simple blog, portfolio, or small business website may not require the complexity of a full-stack framework.\\n\\nThis is where CMS platforms come into play. A CMS provides pre-built functionality, such as content management, user authentication, and database management, allowing developers to focus on customization rather than reinventing the wheel. However, the decision to use a CMS, a framework, or even a native language depends on the specific requirements of your project.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## When to Use a Native Language, Framework, or CMS \ud83e\udd14\\n\\n### 1. When to Use a Native Language (e.g., JavaScript, Python, PHP) \ud83d\udcbb\\n\\n- Use Case: Small, simple projects or when you need full control over every aspect of the application.\\n- Example: A basic static website, a custom script, or a lightweight API.\\n- Pros \u2705: Complete control, no unnecessary overhead, and lightweight.\\n- Cons \u274c: Requires more development time and effort, especially for complex features.\\n\\n### 2. When to Use a Framework or Library (e.g., React, Angular, NestJS) \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f\\n\\n- Use Case: Medium to large-scale applications that require custom functionality, scalability, and flexibility.\\n- Example: E-commerce platforms, SaaS applications, or real-time applications.\\n- Pros \ud83d\udd04: Reusable components, structured codebase, and access to a rich ecosystem of tools and libraries.\\n- Cons \u26a0\ufe0f: Steeper learning curve, longer development time, and higher costs for maintenance.\\n\\n### 3. When to Use a CMS (e.g., Strapi, WordPress, Contentful) \ud83d\udce6\\n\\n- Use Case: Content-heavy websites, blogs, or projects where rapid development and ease of use are priorities.\\n- Example: Corporate websites, blogs, portfolios, or small e-commerce sites.\\n- Pros \ud83d\ude80: Faster development, built-in features (e.g., content management, SEO tools), and easier for non-technical users to manage.\\n- Cons \ud83d\udd12: Limited flexibility compared to custom solutions, potential performance overhead, and dependency on the CMS ecosystem.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Key Scenarios Where a CMS Shines \u2728\\n\\n### 1. Content-Heavy Websites \ud83d\udcf0\\n\\nIf your project involves managing a large amount of content (e.g., blogs, news sites, or documentation), a CMS is ideal. Platforms like WordPress or Strapi provide intuitive interfaces for content creation, editing, and organization.\\n\\n### 2. Rapid Development \u26a1\\n\\nWhen time-to-market is critical, a CMS can significantly speed up development. With pre-built templates, plugins, and themes, you can launch a website in days rather than weeks.\\n\\n### 3. Non-Technical Users \ud83d\udc65\\n\\nIf the website will be managed by non-technical users (e.g., marketers or content creators), a CMS offers an easy-to-use interface for updating content without requiring coding knowledge.\\n\\n### 4. Budget Constraints \ud83d\udcb0\\n\\nFor small businesses or startups with limited budgets, a CMS can reduce development costs by eliminating the need for custom coding and ongoing maintenance.\\n\\n### 5. SEO and Marketing Tools \ud83d\udcc8\\n\\nMany CMS platforms come with built-in SEO tools, analytics integrations, and marketing features, making it easier to optimize your site for search engines and track performance.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Top CMS Platforms for Frontend and Backend Development \ud83c\udfc6\\n\\nWhen it comes to choosing a CMS, the landscape is vast and varied. Different types of CMS platforms cater to different needs, whether you\'re building a simple blog, a headless e-commerce site, or a complex enterprise application.
