## üß™ Step 3: Install MongoDB Shell (mongosh)

Starting from MongoDB 6.0+, the legacy `mongo` shell has been replaced with `mongosh`.

1. Download the standalone **MongoDB Shell (mongosh)** from:
   üëâ [https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/shell](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/shell)
2. Choose:
   * OS: Windows
   * Package: Zip Archive
3. Extract the zip file (e.g., to `C:\mongosh`) and optionally add it to your system `PATH`:
   * Open **System Properties** > **Environment Variables**
   * Under **System variables**, find `Path`, click **Edit**, then **New**, and paste the path to the extracted `mongosh.exe`

Now you can open a terminal (Command Prompt or PowerShell) and run:

```bash
mongosh
```

## üíª Step 4: Install MongoDB Compass

MongoDB Compass is the official GUI for interacting with your MongoDB database visually.

1. Visit: [https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/compass](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/compass)
2. Choose the **latest version** and download the `.exe` installer.
3. Run the installer and follow the default steps.

Once installed, launch Compass and connect to:

```
mongodb://localhost:27017
```

You should see your MongoDB instance running.

## ‚úÖ Step 5: Verify Your Installation

Let‚Äôs test everything to ensure MongoDB is up and running:

### üîπ 1. Check MongoDB Service Status

Open **Command Prompt** and run:

```bash
sc query MongoDB
```

You should see `RUNNING` under `STATE`.

### üîπ 2. Connect via MongoDB Shell

Run:

```bash
mongosh
```

Expected output:

```
Current Mongosh Log ID...
Connecting to:        mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/
Using MongoDB:        7.x.x
```

Then test a basic command:

```js
show dbs
```

You should see default databases like `admin`, `config`, and `local`.

### üîπ 3. Connect via MongoDB Compass

* Launch Compass
* Use connection string: `mongodb://localhost:27017`
* Click **Connect**
* You should see your databases listed.

## üßπ Optional: Create a Test Database

In `mongosh`, run:

```js
use blogTestDB
db.articles.insertOne({ title: "Hello MongoDB", created_at: new Date() })
db.articles.find()
```

You should see your inserted document.
